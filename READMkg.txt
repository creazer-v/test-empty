To create images like the ones you shared, the prompt needs to capture the detailed atmosphere, the specific style, and the visual composition. Here's a breakdown for each:

### First Image Prompt (Green Porsche in a garage):
"Create an illustration of a classic Porsche 911 in a rustic garage setting, with open garage doors revealing a scenic mountain landscape with snow-capped peaks. The lighting is soft, coming through the open windows and the garage door, creating a peaceful and nostalgic atmosphere. The garage is filled with tools, car parts, and shelves stocked with supplies, emphasizing the cozy yet detailed workspace. There are touches of greenery outside, enhancing the serene, natural surroundings. The style is clean and slightly animated, with careful attention to the car's sleek, vintage lines and the warm, welcoming garage space."

### Second Image Prompt (Red sports car in an old Japanese street garage):
"Generate an illustration of a vibrant red sports car parked in a narrow garage along a traditional Japanese street. The setting combines modernity with nostalgia, as the garage is packed with tools, equipment, and various plants. The street outside features traditional Japanese architecture with wooden roofs, lanterns, and autumn leaves falling from a tree overhead. The lighting is bright and sharp, with strong shadows cast by the sunlight. The overall style is clean, animated, and detailed, creating a peaceful scene with a mix of mechanical and natural elements, where the car contrasts with the tranquil environment."

These prompts emphasize the environments, the specific style, and the details that make each image visually appealing.
